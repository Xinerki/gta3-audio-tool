# gta3-audio-tool
"small" python script to unpack/repack gta3 audio files

# Usage
- Put `SFX.RAW` and `sfx.SDT` in same folder as the script and .lst (lst is very important)
- run the script:
## Unpacking:
`py stuf.py e`

## Rebuilding:
`py stuf.py w`

# ⚠️⚠️MAKE BACKUPS⚠️⚠️
the script will export .wav files that you can edit as much as you want then re-pack them back into sfx.raw/sdt. Make sure you actually have all the files and don't edit the .lst (unless u know how) - very important
